        <h1>Diary Entry - June 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>Nothing Just Today I started this blog WOW!! Let's see If it works. 
        @12pm
        why started? bcoz i had a terrible dream and i want to tell some one so here we are. dream(is it dream?): fucking a brown bear stormed my village and just looking here and there going after village people and it suddenly met me and chased me like fucking nothing else i ran, run ran anr ran in my dream remembering the tricks shown discovery channels i shouted loudly, I run curvly still there. BB wasn't in a mood of stopping at all untill it catches me. Even I tried throwing my bag (ig laptop bag, why the hell laptop bag was with me) still the BB was behind me and i started undressing myself in the hope it will stop(to check the clothes)  but not and suddenly no where to run it was in front of me fuck what to do now.opened my Eyes(tried and opened little)
        what the hell it's a dream really, first thing comes to mind what does it means search the internet in half eye open state while making minimal efforts to type the required search query and what i got it signifies that you are trying to avoid something that you don't like and you are going to face it at last now where to go. Yeah it was relatable my Boss(The BB) and me unskilled khamballo(knows nothing) have to face him now finally (5th day at the office).
        The day started like this and normal washed and got freshed in the shitty washroom and got to do breakfast(bonda + chutney) what's that never had before.and goes to office same thing going in the head.but everything in the office goes okay and today i feel little productive as i guess ready to take risk and knows the consequence.
        can't write now fe...el...l...ing s..leee...py Bye Guys Sign OFF!!
