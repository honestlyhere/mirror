        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Early Days and Moving Around</h2>
            <p>When I was in my 8th standard, my elder brother (11th standard) had gone to KOTA for preparation and me with the family went there for leaving him there and came back. After a short while, we went to BBSR, Odisha as father got transferred there.</p>
            <p>So going to a NEW city, I didn't have any idea of anything of IIT or any such. But somehow I appeared for the entrance test of FIITJEE and yeah I don't remember about the score as such but I did end up joining a local coaching for 8th and 9th. I did well in school (K.V) in 9th. I again appeared for the FIITJEE entrance test for admission into the 10th batch. The test that I appeared for was a pretty late one occurring in the month of May so I guess yeah very few people appeared for the test but I didn't have any idea. When the result got declared, I scored somewhere around 531/831 and FIITJEE was offering ~70% scholarship and yeah the fees earlier 3.5L got reduced to 70-80k (got lucky 1), which seemed reasonable to me and my father, so we decided on admission. And yeah, there I was in FIITJEE for 10th, 11th, 12th being an average guy and doing well in school, being in top somehow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Shifting Schools and Discovering Biotechnology</h2>
            <p>Ohh the school K.V when I got transferred from Sambalpur to Bhubaneswar, yeah due to less no of seats in shift 1 (normal hours) I got admitted to shift 2 (abnormal hours). So in 10th, going to FIITJEE and school seemed difficult but managed (going directly to coaching from school). But on going to 11th, I decided to go to shift 1 anyhow so that I can focus more. But not that easy! Schools don't allow such change having CS as optional and going to shift 1 (eh eh NA), so the only way was if you opt for Biotechnology (what's that in 11th?) then you can. Very few students took that. As I had no other way and I had to do it for managing coaching, I opted for it not knowing what it was.</p>
            <p>So yeah I got introduced to Biotechnology here.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>COVID and Board Exams</h2>
            <p>Next continuation will be done later. Let's complete the story. You get how I got introduced to biotech, surprisingly in 12th standard COVID hit so the exams THE BOARD EXAMS were held for 4 of the papers and the exam for biotech is still to be done but lockdown was put in place so the exam was prorated based on the other exams scores (Thank GOD). This was the paper that I was fearful for (thinking of failing it) but due to prorating I got 97 in it (got lucky 2), and with a 93.4% I got my senior secondary degree. Surprisingly this is the exact number I had scored in my 10th 467/500 can't believe it! Haash! class 12th done.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>JEE and Getting into IIT-K</h2>
            <p>But the JEE ADV was still there. I scored some 96.5 percentile. I did messed up and got a rank around ~46K (getting into NIT Rkl), pretty sad but then ADV was there. The result was declared. I know I did bad in the paper (score 85) and got a rank of 21,790, can't get a seat in any institutions but you know I'm lucky, surprisingly that year due to COVID the result (or the examination itself) was conducted pretty late so the result was declared around Sep-Oct. So what most of the students (good ones) thought, let's wait for 3-4 more months and appear for next year Mains and ADV, so they didn't opt for the seats. And also that same year the government had increased the seats of IITs. With this much rank and with OBC category I got a seat at the esteemed IIT-K. I was the last OBC student to get admitted into IIT-K that year. How lucky I am, and got admitted to BS-ES branch. Parents and relatives were happy, but I was not feeling anything, not bad not happy just there nothing, rather I was worried about the fact how I'm going to survive there with this much rank (more importantly why I'm going there) and wait more imp tension was how I'm going to pay the whopping subsidised IIT fees (~15 lacs) this was worrying me the most.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Adjusting to IIT-K and Changing Branches</h2>
            <p>During the JOSAA Counselling process I was also getting BS-MS in Bioengineering from IIT-Madras, I was not happy at that time, as it's not a B.Tech degree and it's 5 years more money should be spent (tensed) and all but finally ended up in the ES department of IITK.</p>
            <p>And COVID was also there so everything went online. As I said before being a khambaloo the beginning year was wasted no connection, not able to cheat, and as my standard I scored a mere of 6.47 SPI in first sem. Tensed, I called my Bapu (SG IITK), he told me to chill, work harder and you will get 7 CPI by second year. My 2nd sem SPI was ~4.8 (I got D grade in almost all the subjects) and hence the CPI was 5.8. Surprisingly before all this I got a scholarship i.e. MCM that everybody gets nearly 25% of that batch for the first year. I got a whopping 2 lacs reimbursed which was a big relief, and this thing finally made my father happy that he decided to have some sweets. But getting the scholarships has some criteria that you should have a CPI>6 and income < 6lpa. Income I managed to show but CPI was not, so I didn't get the scholarship for the 2nd year. Tensed times, but in that time I also applied for branch change application form and filled all the departments not caring about the order (as I was thinking in this earth there was no way I'm getting it).</p>
            <p>But as a lucky fella the branch got changed to BSBE (Biological sciences and Bioengineering). See, it feels like there is something about Bioengineering that is keeping me here, I have to do something in this field. So yeah that's how I ended up here.</p>
